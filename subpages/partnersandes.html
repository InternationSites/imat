                        <strong>Universidade de Lisboa (Instituto Superior Técnico - UL/IST)</strong> is the largest and most reputed
                        school of engineering, science and technology in Portugal. About 1.000 students choose
                        Técnico annually to consolidate a period of studies or a degree in Portugal, demonstrating the institution
                        vitality. A
                        multidisciplinary environment, open to internationalization and strongly oriented towards a global culture
                        offers the
                        students, Portuguese or foreign, the ability to maximize their capabilities, explore Técnico Lisboa's prestige
                        and
                        educational requirements and consolidate their knowledge in a motivating academic and social environment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Técnico Lisboa's internationalization takes place under sustainable and high-quality pillars, with clear
                        security to
                        establish the most different projects and flows of international mobility in its field. The international growth
                        and the
                        world projection of IST results in various international partnerships that result on the possibility of
                        different
                        international mobilities such as master's or a double degree doctoral programme, internships, professional or
                        intensive
                        courses.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Furthermore, Técnico Lisboa also plays a particularly active role in the organization of events and initiatives
                        that
                        highlight the internationalization of the institution, such as the International Days, the International Staff
                        Week, and
                        the Mobility Open Day, which are activities where the whole IST community is invited to know at first hand the
                        international opportunities and the partners that participate directly in this process. Furthermore, its use of
                        social
                        networks is also a prominent element, getting closer to the student community and adapting its content to their
                        needs.
                        That is why, within the scope of the implementation of this project, IST becomes a fundamental partner for its
                        proper
                        implementation.

                        development of the country’s economy. Invariably, AGH University’s ambition has been getting ahead of the present time,

                        <strong>Universidad Católica San Pablo (UCSP)</strong> is a private, non-profit Peruvian institution of higher
                        education, focused on humanistic and professional training. It has only one branch in Arequipa, with a main office in
                        the traditional neighborhood of San Lázaro, located in the historic center of the city. It also has three locations in
                        the historic center of Arequipa.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        UCSP welcomes, promotes and executes various initiatives, its own and those of third parties, to achieve an authentic
                        integral development of solidarity in the region and the country, with special emphasis on those that promote
                        reconciliation and integration of civil, university, business and labor authorities to articulate a common effort.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The International Relations and Cooperation Department (DRIC) of UCSP is in charge of establishing the guidelines and
                        the internationalization strategy of our institution, whose work is directly related to the identity of the UCSP as a
                        Catholic university and, therefore, open to the world. From its specific mission of evangelizing culture, it is natural
                        for UCSP to be open to every culture and country. This openness is evidenced in two directions: first, in welcoming
                        those who come from other countries and in the presence of the members of our community and their contributions in the
                        world. Sharing with foreigners greatly enriches our own experience, not only because we learn from other cultures and
                        perspectives, but also because the universality of the search for Truth that animates the academic community of UCSP is
                        confirmed. To achieve this bidirectional contact with the world, DRIC is in constant contact with institutions of higher
                        education (IES) around the world, international organizations, cooperation agencies, embassies, etc. This contribution
                        is closely related to each of the Professional Schools and the various Centers and Departments of UCSP to contribute to
                        the projection of our academic community in social, cultural and research areas, in accordance with the identity of the
                        university.
