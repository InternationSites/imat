                        <strong>Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP): </strong>Academic rigour, the plurality of scientific and

                        <strong>Universidad Católica San Pablo (UCSP)</strong> is a private, non-profit Peruvian institution of higher
                        education, focused on humanistic and professional training. It has only one branch in Arequipa, with a main office in
                        the traditional neighborhood of San Lázaro, located in the historic center of the city. It also has three locations in
                        the historic center of Arequipa.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        UCSP welcomes, promotes and executes various initiatives, its own and those of third parties, to achieve an authentic
                        integral development of solidarity in the region and the country, with special emphasis on those that promote
                        reconciliation and integration of civil, university, business and labor authorities to articulate a common effort.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The International Relations and Cooperation Department (DRIC) of UCSP is in charge of establishing the guidelines and
                        the internationalization strategy of our institution, whose work is directly related to the identity of the UCSP as a
                        Catholic university and, therefore, open to the world. From its specific mission of evangelizing culture, it is natural
                        for UCSP to be open to every culture and country. This openness is evidenced in two directions: first, in welcoming
                        those who come from other countries and in the presence of the members of our community and their contributions in the
                        world. Sharing with foreigners greatly enriches our own experience, not only because we learn from other cultures and
                        perspectives, but also because the universality of the search for Truth that animates the academic community of UCSP is
                        confirmed. To achieve this bidirectional contact with the world, DRIC is in constant contact with institutions of higher
                        education (IES) around the world, international organizations, cooperation agencies, embassies, etc. This contribution
                        is closely related to each of the Professional Schools and the various Centers and Departments of UCSP to contribute to
                        the projection of our academic community in social, cultural and research areas, in accordance with the identity of the
                        university.

                        <strong>The Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte</strong> stems from the Universidade of Rio Grande do Norte,
                        created on June 25th, 1958, through a state law and was federalized on December 18th, 1960. It was installed on March
                        21st, 1959, and constituted from faculties and higher education schools already existent in Natal, such as the Faculty
                        of Pharmacy and Dentistry, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Medicine, and the School of Engineering, among others.
                        Currently, UFRN is present in 2 campi in Natal - Central Campus and Health Campus - and in 5 campi in the countryside;
                        Caicó Campus - CERES; Currais Novos Campus - CERES; Campus of the Brain - Neurosciences Institute; Macaíba Campus -
                        Jundiaí Agricultural School and Santa Cruz Campus - Faculty of Health Sciences of Trairi, in 62 municipalities with
                        community service actions and in 20 on-ground poles for distance learning support, 13 of these located in Rio Grande do
                        Norte and 7 in other Federal States: Paraíba, Pernambuco, and Alagoas. A recent Restructuring and Expansion Plan of UFRN
                        – REUNI approved for the period 2008-2012 by the Ministry of Education, entails the creation of new undergraduate and
                        postgraduate programs and the expansion of the number of students to 45,000. It establishes the expansion of the student
                        assistance policies, student and faculty mobility, curricular innovations and social inclusion, and the hiring of new
                        academic and technical-administrative staff.

                      <p>
                        In the past few years, UFRN has been developing structuring actions to advance in the search for quality and
                        internationalization, with the development of science, technological innovation, social inclusion, and strengthening the
                        interaction with society and governments. These initiatives create academically structuring scenarios, involve
                        interaction among the major branches of knowledge, and open up possibilities for future action. Several programs and
                        partnerships were created, such as Edmond and Lily Safra International Neurosciences Institute of Natal, UFRN’s
                        International Institute of Physics, National Science and Technology Institutes (CNPq/INCTs), Center of Petroleum and
                        Renewable Energies, Institute of Tropical Medicine of Rio Grande do Norte – IMTRN, Digital Metropolis, and Institute of
